⚠️YouTube Auto Opener with Logging (Batch Script)
This project contains a simple Windows batch script that repeatedly opens a specific YouTube URL and logs each attempt to a text file on the desktop.

📌 Features

Opens a specified YouTube video continuously in the background.

Writes a timestamped log entry to on the user's desktop.log.txt

Automatically launches multiple instances of the script for stronger effect.

Runs in an infinite loop until manually closed.

⚙️ How It Works

The script uses a loop to open the given URL via command prompt.

On each iteration, it appends a line with the current date and time to .log.txt

It waits 1 second between each iteration to prevent system overload.

🚀 Getting Started

Download or clone the repository.

Right-click the file and choose Run as administrator (if needed)..bat

The script will start opening the YouTube link and create a file on your desktop.log.txt
